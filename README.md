## About

Hi, im Mocbuilder.

I'm a hobby programmer mostly working with C#. I mainly program for fun and learning but sometimes something usefull is created, and I try to make it fairly complete.

As I'm still learning I always appreciate feedback on anything that I publish.
Also, I have all my links on [Linktree](linktr.ee/mocbuilder).
