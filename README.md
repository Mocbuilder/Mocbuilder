## Mocbuilder (from Mocbuilder Coding Creations)

Hi, im Mocbuilder.

I'm a self-taught (_or rather: self-learning_) C# programmer. I mainly program for fun and learning but sometimes something usefull is created, and I try to make it fairly complete.

As I'm still learning I would always appreciate feedback on anything that I publish, and I'm always open to constructive criticism.

So, if you'd like to contact me I have all my social-links on [my Linktree](https://linktr.ee/mocbuildercodingcreations).
